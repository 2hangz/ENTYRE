Over 40,000 tonnes of waste tyres are collected in Ireland each year. In the past, these were sent to landfill, recycled as infill material for sports pitches, arenas, playgrounds etc., or exported to, predominantly Asian, countries where they were burned for fuel.  
However, EU regulations have banned landfilling of tyres as they leach toxins into soils, provide breeding grounds for pests, and take up a significant amount of space. The microplastics ban states they cannot be used as infill going forward, and to create a circular economy, ban on exports outside the EU are being considered.

Therefore, it is vital Ireland relies on a new method of waste tyre management. This project will provide a comprehensive review of the various methods and technologies associated with waste tyre management, including energy recovery, civil engineering applications, and devulcanisation.  
After in-depth research and stakeholder consultation, a Multicriteria Decision Making (MCDM) tool will rank the various options for End-of-Life tyres (ELT), outlining the most economically and environmentally sensible waste tyre management plan.
